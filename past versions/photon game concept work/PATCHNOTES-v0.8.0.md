# Patch Notes — v0.8.0 Goals + Rapid Fire

**Faster pew-pew**
- Default **fire rate 24/s** (was ~12). Adjust with **[** and **]**. Battery recharge bumped slightly; high frequency still costs more.

**Goals/Missions**
- Three sample missions with a **goals panel** on the right:
  - **Rookie Tech:** break 6 total; at least 2 of A₂.
  - **UV Caution:** break 3 of H₂; make 3 **precise** breaks within ±20 nm of the bond λ.
  - **Reactive Mix:** break 10 total, 2× O₂ and 2× CO, **under 90s**.
- Progress updates live with [✓]/[ ] checkboxes. Clear = overlay with time; **N** advances.

**Quality**
- Kept all visibility safeguards, center ping, aim dots.
- Fire rate control and cheaper per-shot cost to keep it fun at speed.

**Controls refresher**
- Move WASD; aim mouse; Space/Click to fire; **T** toggle autofire; **[ / ]** fire rate; 1..5 presets; -/= fine tune; **G** drain; **P** pause; **N** next; **R** retry; **C** center; **V** beacon; **F** ping; **D** debug.
